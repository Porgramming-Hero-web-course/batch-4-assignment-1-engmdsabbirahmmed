Topic: The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

 
Union and intersection are important in Typescript. These two make the code more flexible and help to make the data type safe.
Union =>:  The value of a variable can hold values ​​of more than one type rather than being of a specific type. and its value can be any one of multiple values.

let value: string | number;
value = "Hello from Sabbir"; 
value = 56;

Here we can declare this variable with data of string or number type due to giving variable type string | number.

Intersection =>:
We can use intersession to join or convert multiple types into one type.

type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };
type PersonEmployee = Person & Employee;

const employee: PersonEmployee = {
  name: "Sabbir",
  employeeId: 420,
};
For example, we can convert a string type and a number type to an object type by intersection.
